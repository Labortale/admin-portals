## Installation

### Using CurseForge App

The easiest way to install mods is via the [CurseForge App](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), which handles installation and updates automatically.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the mod JAR file
2. Place it in the mods directory:
   - **Windows:** `%appdata%\Hytale\UserData\Mods`
   - **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/Hytale/UserData/Mods`
   - **Linux (Flatpak):** `~/.var/app/com.hypixel.HytaleLauncher/data/Hytale/UserData/Mods`
   - **Dedicated Server:** `/mods` folder in your server directory
3. Restart the game or server

Since Hytale uses a server internally for both singleplayer and multiplayer, this mod works in both modes.

| Permission                               | Description                              |

| `hiwire.adminportals.portal.config.view` | Open the portal configuration UI         |
| `hiwire.adminportals.portal.config.edit` | Save changes to the portal configuration |

## Configuration

### Entering Configuration Mode

To configure portals, you must first enter configuration mode by running:

```
/adminportals configmode toggle
```

While in configuration mode, interacting with a portal block using the interact key will open the configuration UI.
Run the command again to exit configuration mode.

### Configuration UI

![Portal Configuration UI](docs/images/portal-configuration-ui.png)

The configuration UI allows you to set the following options:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**            | The config type. Currently only the "Command" type is supported                                               |
| **Commands**        | A list of commands to execute when the player activates the portal. Each command has its own execution mode. Use the "Add Command" button to add more |
| **Execute As**      | Per-command setting: `Server` - runs the command as console / CommandSender; `Player` - runs the command as the interacting player |
| **Teleport Sound**  | Sound effect ID to play when the portal is activated. Leave empty for no sound (default: `SFX_Portal_Neutral_Teleport_Local`) |
| **Map Marker Text** | Optional label displayed on the world map and compass                                                         |
| **Map Marker Icon** | Icon filename from server assets for the map marker (default: `Warp.png`)                                     |
| **Collision**       | Enable or disable portal activation when a player walks through the portal's hitbox (default: enabled)        |
| **Use**             | Enable or disable portal activation when a player presses the interact key (default: enabled)                 |

### Map Markers

When you configure a portal with a **Map Marker Text**, the portal will be displayed on the world map and compass, making it easy for players to locate.

**Portal marker on the world map:**

**Portal marker on the compass:**

## Placeholders

Use these placeholders in portal commands. They are replaced with actual values when the portal is activated.

| Placeholder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `{PlayerUsername}` | Username of the player activating the portal |
| `{PlayerUuid}` | UUID of the player activating the portal |
| `{PosX}` | X coordinate of the portal block |
| `{PosY}` | Y coordinate of the portal block |
| `{PosZ}` | Z coordinate of the portal block |
| `{WorldName}` | Name of the world containing the portal |

### Example Commands

A portal can have multiple commands that run in sequence. Each command can have its own execution mode.

For example, a portal could be configured with the following commands:
1. `tp {PlayerUsername} 100 64 200` (Execute As: Server)
2. `say Player {PlayerUsername} has entered a portal` (Execute As: Server)
3. `spawn` (Execute As: Player)

## Portal Blocks

![All Portal Types](docs/images/portal-lineup-night.png)
_Additional screenshots (daytime views, etc.) can be found [here](docs/images/)._

Portal blocks can be found in the creative inventory under **Blocks > Portals**.

### Using Portals

Players can activate a configured portal in two ways (both enabled by default, configurable per portal):
- **Collision** - Walking through the portal's hitbox
- **Use** - Pressing the interact key on the portal

![Portal Interact Prompt](docs/images/portal-interact.png)

If a portal has not been configured yet, the player will receive a chat message indicating that the portal is not configured.

### Portal Base (Two-Piece Setup)

The Portal Base is a decorative pad that serves as a foundation for portal effects. The portal base portals are vertically offset to sit perfectly on top of the base.

- `HiWire_AdminPortals_PortalBase` - The base pad
- `HiWire_AdminPortals_PortalBase_Portal_ForgottenTemple` - Blue portal effect (designed to sit on the base)
- `HiWire_AdminPortals_PortalBase_Portal_Void` - Purple portal effect (designed to sit on the base)

### Standalone Portals

Self-contained portal blocks that are aligned with the world grid. The bottom of the portal aligns with the block boundary, so they sit flush on the ground without floating like portals on top of a base.

- `HiWire_AdminPortals_StandalonePortal_ForgottenTemple` - Blue standalone portal
- `HiWire_AdminPortals_StandalonePortal_Void` - Purple standalone portal

## Customization

The mod supports user overrides for translations, UI definitions, and assets. Place your customizations in the mod's data folder under `mods/HiWire_AdminPortals_Overrides`.

### Translation Files

The mod uses translation files located in `/Server/Languages/{language}/HiWire/AdminPortals/`:

- `Items.lang` - Portal item names and descriptions
- `ChatMessages.lang` - Chat notifications and command messages
- `UI.lang` - User interface labels

Translation files with all keys are created and automatically updated at `mods/HiWire_AdminPortals_Overrides/Server/Languages/{language}/HiWire/AdminPortals/`.
Edit these files to customize translations without modifying the original mod files.

### Custom Placeholders

Mod developers can register custom placeholders by accessing the `PlaceholderManager`:

```java
final var plugin = PluginManager.get().getPlugin(new PluginIdentifier("HiWire", "AdminPortals"));
if (plugin instanceof AdminPortalsPlugin adminPortalsPlugin) {
    final var placeholderManager = adminPortalsPlugin.getPlaceholderManager();

    // Register a simple placeholder. It can be used with {ServerName}
    placeholderManager.register("ServerName", ctx -> "My Server");

    // Register a placeholder using context data
    placeholderManager.register("PlayerHealth", ctx -> {
        final var playerRef = ctx.playerRef();
        final var health = // Get player health via playerRef
        return String.valueOf(health);
    });
}
```

The `PlaceholderContext` provides access to:
- `playerRef()` - The player activating the portal
- `world()` - The world containing the portal
- `pos()` - The block position (Vector3i)
- `portalConfig()` - The portal's configuration
- `itemStack()` - The item used for interaction (nullable)
- `interactionType()` - The type of interaction
- `interactionContext()` - Additional interaction context
